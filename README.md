📈 **Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
🧠 **Overview**

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical stock market data and machine learning models. It utilizes supervised learning techniques like Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Random Forest to forecast future stock prices based on historical trends. The goal is to help users visualize, analyze, and make informed decisions based on model predictions.

🔍 **Features**

Real-time data fetching using yfinance or preloaded CSV

Data preprocessing and normalization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization

Model training using:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

LSTM (Deep Learning)

Evaluation using MAE, RMSE

Predictive visualization (Actual vs Predicted)

User-friendly plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn

🧰 **Tech Stack**
Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Keras / TensorFlow (for LSTM)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

yfinance (for fetching live stock data)
